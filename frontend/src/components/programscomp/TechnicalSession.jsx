            workshopTitle: "Next-Gen Transportation: EVs, Drone Technology & Emerging Innovations",
            introduction: `In the context of rising global emissions and climate change, the global focus is on safeguarding the planet. Extensive research is being conducted worldwide to mitigate emissions—the primary contributor to global warming. Electric and hybrid vehicles are essential solutions that not only demonstrate reduced emissions but also utilize renewable energy sources, thereby mitigating the depletion of fossil fuels.
                        Alongside advancements in electric mobility, drone technology (Unmanned Aerial Systems - UAS) is emerging as a transformative component of next-generation transportation. Electric-powered drones are revolutionizing logistics, surveillance, agriculture, emergency response, and urban mobility. By reducing dependency on traditional fuel-based transport systems—especially for last-mile delivery—drones contribute to lower carbon footprints and improved energy efficiency.
                        Despite extensive global research in electric, hybrid, and autonomous mobility systems, significant technological and infrastructural gaps remain. Challenges such as battery efficiency, energy storage, charging infrastructure, airspace regulation, safety frameworks, and integration of AI-driven autonomous systems continue to shape ongoing research and development efforts.
                        This program elucidates existing electric, hybrid, and drone technologies while enabling attendees to understand future market trends, regulatory landscapes, and technological developments. Participants will gain insight into sustainable transportation ecosystems, smart mobility integration, and the role of renewable energy in next-generation transport systems.
                        This platform fosters the sharing of ideas and interdisciplinary collaboration, paving the way for sustainable industrial development and innovative solutions for a greener future.`,
