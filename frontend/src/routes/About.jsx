              NIT Patna marked its humble beginning in 1886 with the establishment of Pleaders Survey Training School, which was subsequently promoted to Bihar College of Engineering Patna in 1924. This made this institute the 6th oldest engineering institute of India. The graduate-level curriculum was later elevated to the postgraduate level in 1978.
